This program will get a tax / insurance breakdown for a range of gross incomes.

Technical inspiration from 03l54rd1n3's [brutto netto](https://github.com/03l54rd1n3/brutto-netto).

## Disclaimer

This project serves as an exercise for me to learn Golang - there will be a lot of cases where the program will abruptly exit.

Don't consider it stable.
